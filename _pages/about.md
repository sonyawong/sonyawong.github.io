Prior to TAL, I got my M.S degree at NLP2CT Lab in University of Macau, advised by Prof. Derek F. Wong and got my B.E. degree in Logistic Management at Zhejiang Gongshang University.

My research interests include **AI in Education**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Large Language Models**, etc.

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

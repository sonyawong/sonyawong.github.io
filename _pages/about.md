I am currently a first-year PhD student in [Manning College of Information & Computer Sciences](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/), fortunately advised by [Prof. Andrew Lan](https://people.umass.edu/~andrewlan/). 

Before that, I was an algorithm engineer at [TAL Education Group](https://www.100tal.com/en-us/) (NYSE: TAL) and gratefully supervised by [Prof. Zitao Liu](https://www.zitaoliu.com/).

Prior to TAL, I got my M.S. degree in the [NLP2CT Lab](http://nlp2ct.cis.umac.mo/) at the [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/), thankfully advised by [Prof. Derek F. Wong](https://www.fst.um.edu.mo/personal/derek-wong/).

My research interests include **AI in Education**, **Natural Language Processing**, **Large Language Models**, etc.
